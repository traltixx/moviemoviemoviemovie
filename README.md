A Simple way of smooshing two movies together (Based on the International Best Seller Game Movie Movie Game https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thevalleyfolk/movie-movie-game-0 )
Dataset was taken from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/

Movieresult.txt is the result. It takes about 260 seconds for the script to run. The script only takes english movies (based on the dataset) and any movie after 1980.

Attempt to combine synopsis will be next but will have to be very succinct as the current plot summary is very long (from the dataset).
